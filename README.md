# Background
I had no idea I would end up working with data, but looking back it was with me all along. Back in 2010, I started working for a well know banking company, using big data and machine learning to detect trends for "bad actors". Using market research, consumer spending patterns, multifactor authentication (MFA), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) I was able to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. Saving both the consumer and bank millions of dollars. Being the type of person who wants to know the entire process of how things work, I sought out a new opportunity with the homebuying process. Working with the consumer and underwriter allowed me to use data and determine the best loan for the consumer, offers, and price based off individual needs. Using data allowed me to make informed decisions and aid the consumer into purchasing their home.  
Unfortunately, the department dissolved, and I moved on to Small Business Advising. Aiding the consumer to make informed decisions using rates to determine benefits, rewards, cash back, and balance transfers. After years of working in the banking industry I started to realize that I needed to obtain an education to move forward with the company. Due to the constant communication between the bank, lenders, consumers, and other networks, I was under the impression Psychology was the best route for me. After standing out as a star student in research a former professor offered me an opportunity I could not pass up. The research department was the best job in my life thus far. I loved all aspects of what it had to offer. From setting up questionnaires, collecting, building, presenting, data and computing analysis. My love for the job really showed and when COVID hit the department ceased. It was then the department mentioned to me the Data Analytics degree. Acceptance into the Masters Data Analytic program allowed me to showcase all the algorithms, concepts, and techniques I had developed along the way. I am not going to lie but when I take a moment to stop and think about my career journey and how I was dabbling into Data Analytics all along, it really stumps me that I did not obtain my education earlier on.
