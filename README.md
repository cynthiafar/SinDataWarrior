# Background
## I had no idea I would end up working with data, but looking back it was with me all along. Over 10 years ago I started working for a well know banking company, using big data and machine learning to detect trends for "bad actors". Using market research, consumer spending patterns, multifactor authentication (MFA), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) I was able to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. Saving both the consumer and bank millions of dollars. Being the type of person who wants to constantly display growth, I sought out a new opportunities. 

Using data I was able to work with consumers to determine the best loan, offers, and price according to individual needs. Data allowed me to make informed decisions and aid the consumer in purchasing their home. 

As I continued to want to learn more I migrated into Small Business Analysis. Data aided in informing the consumer the best approach to maximize earnings, rewards, and services. All while specializing in customer satisfaction. 

Transitioning out of the banking industry, and because I loved working with the consumer and data. I started off by obtaining my psychology degree. While working on my psychology degree, I was noticed by Professors, for my great communications skills, attention to detail, and in depth research skills. This lead to working in the university research department. 
Working in the research department was some of the best work experience in  my life. My love for statistics and data science stood out and often times I was asked to team up. I was fortune to  gain first hand experience within the research lab leading to some award winning publications. 

When COVID hit it ceased research and it lead me to obtain my Masters in Data Analytics. Acceptance into the Masters program allowed me to showcase algorithms, concepts, analysis and techniques I had developed along the way. 
Taking a moment to stop and think about my career journey Data Analytics was something with me all along. I feel extremely lucky and blessed to have had the opportunity to further my education, and I am humbled by all the people who mentored me along the way.
